*This is a demonstration project for the purpose of sharing and displaying my data analysis skills with the R language. This HTML file is generated from knitting an Rmarkdown file I created for the demonstration. For better demonstration, the content of this document is not in the format of a data analysis report, instead it follows the natural flow of how I work and displays the treated object or result every step at a time. All processed data were obtained from publicly available sources and the work content was created solely for this demonstration. The demonstrated skills in this project include processing, cleaning, wranglling and merging of large datasets, as well as descriptive analysis with mainly visualization.*

### General Information of the Project:

Project name: Demo - Global HIV Epidemic Analysis

Data source: WHO, UNICEF, UNAIDS

Objective: To have a collective look and analysis of the global HIV epidemic for the past 30 years.

Time used: approx. 50hr

Presentation style: Work flow

Remark: The final collective dataset would cover 20+ variables throughout a timespan of 30 years, of all countries worldwide. Any entry where data was unavailable would appear as NA. Due to the nature of NGO collected data from such a wide region and timespan, there are inevidibly many NAs and the final dataset would remain moderately fragmented as well. To avoid losing more data during process, I'm keeping all the NAs from the source data until NA removal is necessary.
